<div class="explanation">
    <h4>FLOWCHART</h4>
    <p>Nodes are connected with the Flowchart connector.</p>
    <p>Hover over connections to highlight them, click to delete. </p>
    <p>Drag new connections from hollow dots to solid dots. You can also drag connections from their source/target to other sources/targets, or back onto themselves.</p>
    <p>By default, Flowchart connectors have square corners, but by setting the 'cornerRadius' parameter, as we have here, you can get rounded corners.</p>
